# PDF Chatbot using LangChain, Ollama, and RAG

This application allows you to interact with a PDF document using natural language queries. It leverages **LangChain** for orchestration, **Ollama** to serve LLMs locally, and implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to answer questions based on PDF content.
